**Q7: Which part of the network is most important to kick off the flywheel (creator, host, audience)?**
<br>Quality content is key to attracting an audience. Once we have an active audience base, this will incentivize more creators and hosts to join, creating a virtuous cycle. Additionally, friends inviting other friends to play together and influencers with large followings can also significantly contribute to kickstarting the network effect.

**Q8: Will you create experiences and find hosts? Or will you find hosts and act as the creator for the host?**
<br>In the early stages, we're developing experiences internally while concurrently conducting outreach to potential creators with relatively small asks to begin with. With the goal of building up their expertise in crafting shows. This dual approach ensures that we can provide high-quality experiences from the start while also building up a community of external creators. We're also targeting influencers who can offer a fun way to engage and monetize their fanbase. As the platform evolves, more creators will independently build experiences and potential hosts will discover them to share with their communities.


**Q9: What is your roadmap?**
<br>Our roadmap is driven by user interest and the goal to make ReelMagic accessible across multiple platforms. We are actively exploring development for iOS and Android to bring our interactive experiences to mobile users. A web version is also in consideration to allow users to engage with ReelMagic directly from their browsers. Beyond these, we're excited about the potential of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies in enhancing the interactive storytelling experience. Technologies such as Apple Vision are on our radar as we envision the future of ReelMagic. Our aim is to continue evolving and innovating to meet the needs of our users and to stay at the forefront of interactive entertainment.
