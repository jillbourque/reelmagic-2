# Our Vision :crystal_ball:

ReelMagic is more than just a product. It's a community, a new form of entertainment, and an opportunity to shape the future of storytelling. 

We envision a future where advanced generative AI transforms group chats into immersive, interactive fiction experiences, brought to life in captivating video content.

By harnessing the power of Discord, we aim to morph ordinary chats into extraordinary video content. 

Looking forward, we're exploring the potential for monetization and growth through Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). We envision empowering the community to own pieces of the content they help create, adding an exciting layer of value to the user experience. 

Join us as we embark on this exciting journey to redefine storytelling and create a whole new world of interactive entertainment!

## Why I Believe The Future of Entertainment is Interactive ## 
Jill Bourque, CEO of RushTix

**Early Career and the Power of "Yes, And"**
<hr>Early in my career, I took an improv class to level up my communication skills for my job in finance. I immediately clicked with the underlying concept of ‚ÄúYes, and‚Äù which means that you take what‚Äôs presented to you in a scene and say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and build upon the idea. This simple idea changed the trajectory of my life in the best possible ways.

## Creation of "How We First Met"
I started performing in shows and then creating my own. One of them, "How We First Met", became extremely successful. The concept was that a host interviews a couple on stage and then at strategic points in the story segues to a team of improvisers and musicians to theatrically re-create their love story in real-time, complete with sketches, songs, dancing, and multimedia. You can see some of the press clippings about the show [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cgdxqelieymjiss/combinepdf.pdf?dl=0).
