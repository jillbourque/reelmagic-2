# Interactive Entertainment: The Next Wave ðŸŒŠ

The next wave of entertainment will undeniably be interactive, whether it's virtual reality, augmented reality, or interactive livestream experiences. ReelMagic is the online building platform for the inevitable wave of interactive entertainment. Before video games, passive entertainment like television and movies made sense. But now we have a generation who has grown up with video games and expects to be an active participant in their entertainment. Whether itâ€™s gaming, texting, sending images to friends, posting and commenting on social media, or creating a piece of video content, they are used to being part of the story. ReelMagic is interactive and immersive from start to finish.

Weâ€™ve created a new category called Interactive Generative Experience (IGE - we call it "Iggy"), but it has roots and similarities to the following genres:

- Netflix Interactive - branching narratives in streaming video (ex. Bandersnatch).
- Choose Your Own Adventure Books - the first mainstream interactive fiction.
- Interactive Fiction - the origins of video games, dating back to the 1970â€™s and still going strong.
- Mass Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games - the excitement of playing in real-time with others.
- Otome Games - narrative branching for a multitude of possible journeys.
- Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) - go on quests and solve puzzles with a community.
- Immersive/Interactive Theater - breaking the fourth wall with real-time interactivity (ex. Sleep No More).
- Improvisational Comedy/Theater - express your own creativity with your response in the story.
- Dungeons & Dragons - tabletop game to embark on journeys with a community of adventurers.
- Escape Rooms - players can work together IRL to solve puzzles and escape from a room.
