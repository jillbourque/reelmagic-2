## Ethical AI Usage

ReelMagic is committed to the responsible and ethical use of AI. We ensure that our AI models are trained on a diverse range of data, minimizing bias and promoting fair representation. We are transparent about our AI usage and ensure our models align with ethical AI guidelines.

## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion

ReelMagic is built on the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to tell and be a part of stories. We strive to create a platform that is inclusive, diverse, and equitable, ensuring that all voices can be heard and represented in our narratives.

We continually work to ensure that our platform, narratives, and community promote and uphold these values. As part of this commitment, we welcome feedback and suggestions that can help us better achieve these goals.
